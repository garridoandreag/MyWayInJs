    <h2>Coding Challenge #3</h2>
    <p>
      There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against
      each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a
      trophy!
    </p>
    <b>Your tasks:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
      </li>
      <li>
        Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the
        competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be
        a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average
        score)
      </li>
      <li>
        Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this
        rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and
        the same time a score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical
        operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks
        ðŸ˜‰
      </li>
      <li>
        Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens
        when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or
        equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
      </li>
    </ol>
    <b>Test data:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
      </li>
      <li>Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123</li>
      <li>Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106</li>
    </ul>
    <p>GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€</p>
